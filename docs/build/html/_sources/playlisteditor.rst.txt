Playlist Editor
===============

It's very straight-forward to create a `Notpad style application <http://www.visual-basic-tutorials.com/form/NotepadT.htm>`_ in VB.NET

The playlist editor will instead contain a data grid where the user can select the media file in the first column, then select whether the file should repeat (or only play-once) using a checkbox in the second column.

(Next we will `read from the data grid <http://stackoverflow.com/a/1031737/1895018>`_).
